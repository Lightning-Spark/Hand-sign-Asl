# Hand sign detection using asl

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to build a neural network able to classify which letter of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is being signed, given an image of a signing hand. This project is a first step towards building a possible sign language translator, which can take communications in sign language and translate them into written language.
